# OAP Installation Guide
This document tells you how to install OAP and its dependencies by Conda on your cluster nodes. For some steps, specific libraries need to be compiled and installed to your system, the course of which requires root access. 

## Contents
  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
      - [Install prerequisites](#install-prerequisites)
  - [Compiling OAP](#compiling-oap)
  - [Configuration](#configuration)

## Prerequisites 

- **OS Requirements**  
We have tested OAP on Fedora 29 and CentOS 7.6. We recommend you to use Fedora 29 and CentOS 7.6 or above.

- **Conda Requirements**   
You need to install Conda on your cluster node.
```bash
wget -c https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod 777 Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh 
bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh 
```
    Then you should create a conda environment to install OAP Conda package.
```bash
conda create -n oapenv python=3.7
conda activate oapenv
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

- **Requirements for Shuffle Remote PMem Extension**  
If you want to use Shuffle Remote PMem Extension with RDMA, you need to configure and validate RDMA before these installation steps. Shuffle Remote PMem Extension also need to install library [PMDK](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk) which we haven't provided a Conda package. You can refer to [Shuffle Remote PMem Extension Guide](../oap-shuffle/RPMem-shuffle/README.md#4-configure-and-validate-rdma) for the details of configuring, validating RDMA and install PMDK. 


```
cd OAP/
export ENABLE_RDMA=true
source ./dev/prepare_oap_env.sh
prepare_PMDK
```

###  Install prerequisites
Some dependencies required by OAP listed below. All of them are included by OAP Conda package, they will be automatically installed in your environment when you conda install OAP. Ensure you have  activated environment which you create in the previous step.
- [Memkind](https://anaconda.org/intel-bigdata/memkind)
- [Vmemcache](https://anaconda.org/intel-bigdata/vmemcache)
- [HPNL](https://anaconda.org/intel-bigdata//hpnl)
- [Arrow-cpp](https://anaconda.org/intel-bigdata/arrow-cpp)  
- [OAP](https://anaconda.org/intel-bigdata/oap)

```bash
conda activate oapenv
conda install -c intel -c conda-forge oap=0.9
```
After install OAP package, you can find compiled OAP jars in `/root/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/`


##  Configuration
After installing prerequisites of OAP successfully, to make sure libraries installed by Conda can be linked by Spark, please add the following configuration settings to "$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults" on the working node.

```
spark.executorEnv.LD_LIBRARY_PATH /root/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/lib/
spark.executor.extraLibraryPath /root/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/lib/
spark.driver.extraLibraryPath /root/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/lib/
spark.executor.extraClassPath      /root/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/$OAP_FEATURE.jar
spark.driver.extraClassPath      /root/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/$OAP_FEATURE.jar
```

And then you can follow the corresponding feature documents for using them.
