## Prerequisites

SQL Index and Data Source Cache on Spark 3.1.1 requires a working Hadoop cluster with YARN and Spark. Running Spark on YARN requires a binary distribution of Spark, which is built with YARN support.

## Getting Started

### Building
We have provided a Conda package which will automatically install dependencies and build OAP jars, please follow [OAP-Installation-Guide](OAP-Installation-Guide.md) and you can find compiled OAP jars under
 `$HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars` once finished the installation.

If youâ€™d like to build from source code, please refer to [Developer Guide](Developer-Guide.md) for the detailed steps.

### Spark Configurations

Users usually test and run Spark SQL or Scala scripts in Spark Shell,  which launches Spark applications on YRAN with ***client*** mode. In this section, we will start with Spark Shell then introduce other use scenarios. 

Before you run `$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell `, you need to configure Spark for integration. You need to add or update the following configurations in the Spark configuration file `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` on your working node.

```bash
spark.sql.extensions              org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions
# absolute path of the jar on your working node
spark.files                       $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar,$HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
# relative path to spark.files, just specify jar name in current dir
spark.executor.extraClassPath     ./plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar:./pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
# absolute path of the jar on your working node
spark.driver.extraClassPath       $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar:$HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
```
### Verify Integration 

After configuration, you can follow these steps to verify the OAP integration is working using Spark Shell.

1. Create a test data path on your HDFS. `hdfs:///user/oap/` for example.

```
   hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/oap/
```

2. Launch Spark Shell using the following command on your working node.

```
   $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell
```

3. Execute the following commands in Spark Shell to test OAP integration. 

```
   
    > spark.sql(s"""CREATE TABLE oap_test (a INT, b STRING)
          USING parquet
          OPTIONS (path 'hdfs:///user/oap/')""".stripMargin)
    > val data = (1 to 30000).map { i => (i, s"this is test $i") }.toDF().createOrReplaceTempView("t")
    > spark.sql("insert overwrite table oap_test select * from t")
    > spark.sql("create oindex index1 on oap_test (a)")
    > spark.sql("show oindex from oap_test").show()
```

This test creates an index for a table and then shows it. If there are no errors, the OAP `.jar` is working with the configuration. The picture below is an example of a successfully run.

![Spark_shell_running_results](./image/spark_shell_oap.png)

## Configuration for YARN Cluster Mode

Spark Shell, Spark SQL CLI and Thrift Sever run Spark application in ***client*** mode. While Spark Submit tool can run Spark application in ***client*** or ***cluster*** mode, which is decided by `--deploy-mode` parameter. [Getting Started](#Getting-Started) session has shown the configurations needed for ***client*** mode. If you are running Spark Submit tool in ***cluster*** mode, you need to follow the below configuration steps instead.

Add the following OAP configuration settings to `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` on your working node before running `spark-submit` in ***cluster*** mode.
```
spark.sql.extensions              org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions
# absolute path on your working node
spark.files                       $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar,$HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
# relative path to spark.files, just specify jar name in current dir   
spark.executor.extraClassPath     ./plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar:./pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
# relative path to spark.files, just specify jar name in current dir
spark.driver.extraClassPath       ./plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar:./pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
```

## Configuration for Spark Standalone Mode

In addition to running on the YARN cluster manager, Spark also provides a simple standalone deploy mode. If you are using Spark in Spark Standalone mode:

1. Make sure the OAP `.jar` at the same path of **all** the worker nodes.
2. Add the following configuration settings to `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` on the working node.
```
spark.sql.extensions               org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions
# absolute path on worker nodes
spark.executor.extraClassPath      $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar:$HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
# absolute path on worker nodes
spark.driver.extraClassPath        $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar:$HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
```

## Working with SQL Index

After a successful OAP integration, you can use OAP SQL DDL to manage table indexes. The DDL operations include `index create`, `drop`, `refresh`, and `show`. Test these functions using the following examples in Spark Shell.

```
> spark.sql(s"""CREATE TABLE oap_test (a INT, b STRING)
       USING parquet
       OPTIONS (path 'hdfs:///user/oap/')""".stripMargin)
> val data = (1 to 30000).map { i => (i, s"this is test $i") }.toDF().createOrReplaceTempView("t")
> spark.sql("insert overwrite table oap_test select * from t")       
```

### Index Creation

Use the CREATE OINDEX DDL command to create a B+ Tree index or bitmap index. 
``` 
CREATE OINDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name) USING [BTREE, BITMAP]
```
The following example creates a B+ Tree index on column "a" of the `oap_test` table.
``` 
> spark.sql("create oindex index1 on oap_test (a)")
```
Use SHOW OINDEX command to show all the created indexes on a specified table.
```
> spark.sql("show oindex from oap_test").show()
```

**NOTE:**
 
Currently SQL Index supports to create index on the following data types of columns:

`ByteType`,`ShortType`,`IntegerType`,`LongType`,`FloatType`,`DoubleType`,`StringType`,`BinaryType`,`BooleanType`

Run DESC <tablename> to make sure the data type of columns, e.g. `DecimalType`, `DateType` are not supported.

```
> spark.sql("desc oap_test").show()
```

### Use Index

Using index in a query is transparent. When SQL queries have filter conditions on the column(s) which can take advantage of the index to filter the data scan, the index will automatically be applied to the execution of Spark SQL. The following example will automatically use the underlayer index created on column "a".
```
> spark.sql("SELECT * FROM oap_test WHERE a = 1").show()
```
**NOTE:**

If you choose to use SQL Index to get performance gain in queries, we recommend you do not create index on small tables, like dimension tables.

### Drop index

Use DROP OINDEX command to drop a named index.
```
> spark.sql("drop oindex index1 on oap_test")
```

## Working with SQL Data Source Cache

Data Source Cache can provide input data cache functionality to the executor. When using the cache data among different SQL queries, configure cache to allow different SQL queries to use the same executor process. Do this by running your queries through the Spark ThriftServer as shown below. For cache media, we support both DRAM and Intel PMem which means you can choose to cache data in DRAM or Intel PMem if you have PMem configured in hardware.

### Use DRAM Cache 

1. Make the following configuration changes in Spark configuration file `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf`. 

```
   spark.memory.offHeap.enabled                      false
   spark.oap.cache.strategy                          guava
   spark.sql.oap.cache.memory.manager                offheap
   # according to the resource of cluster
   spark.executor.memoryOverhead                     50g
   # equal to the size of executor.memoryOverhead
   spark.executor.sql.oap.cache.offheap.memory.size  50g
   # for parquet fileformat, enable binary cache
   spark.sql.oap.parquet.binary.cache.enabled        true
   # for orc fileformat, enable binary cache
   spark.sql.oap.orc.binary.cache.enabled            true
```

   ***NOTE***: Change `spark.executor.sql.oap.cache.offheap.memory.size` based on the availability of DRAM capacity to cache data, and its size is equal to `spark.executor.memoryOverhead`

2. Launch Spark ***ThriftServer***

   Launch Spark Thrift Server, and use the Beeline command line tool to connect to the Thrift Server to execute DDL or DML operations. The data cache will automatically take effect for Parquet or ORC file sources. 
   
   The rest of this section will show you how to do a quick verification of cache functionality. It will reuse the database metastore created in the [Working with SQL Index](#Working-with-SQL-Index) section, which creates the `oap_test` table definition. In production, Spark Thrift Server will have its own metastore database directory or metastore service and use DDL's through Beeline for creating your tables.

   When you run ```spark-shell``` to create the `oap_test` table, `metastore_db` will be created in the directory where you ran '$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell'. ***Go to that directory*** and execute the following command to launch Thrift JDBC server and run queries.

```
   $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-thriftserver.sh
```

3. Use Beeline and connect to the Thrift JDBC server, replacing the hostname (mythriftserver) with your own Thrift Server hostname.

```
   . $SPARK_HOME/bin/beeline -u jdbc:hive2://<mythriftserver>:10000       
```

   After the connection is established, execute the following commands to check the metastore is initialized correctly.

```
   > SHOW databases;
   > USE default;
   > SHOW tables;
```
 
4. Run queries on the table that will use the cache automatically. For example,

```
   > SELECT * FROM oap_test WHERE a = 1;
   > SELECT * FROM oap_test WHERE a = 2;
   > SELECT * FROM oap_test WHERE a = 3;
   ...
```

5. Open the Spark History Web UI and go to the OAP tab page to verify the cache metrics. The following picture is an example.

   ![webUI](./image/webUI.png)


### Use PMem Cache 

#### Prerequisites

The following steps are required to configure OAP to use PMem cache with `external` cache strategy.

- PMem hardware is successfully deployed on each node in cluster.

- Besides, when enabling SQL Data Source Cache with external cache using Plasma, PMem could get noticeable performance gain with BIOS configuration settings below, especially on cross socket write path.

```
Socket Configuration -> Memory Configuration -> NGN Configuration -> Snoopy mode for AD : Enabled
Socket Configuration -> Intel UPI General Configuration -> Stale AtoS :  Disabled
``` 

- It's strongly advised to use [Linux device mapper](https://pmem.io/2018/05/15/using_persistent_memory_devices_with_the_linux_device_mapper.html) to interleave PMem across sockets and get maximum size for Plasma.


```
   // use ipmctl command to show topology and dimm info of PMem
   ipmctl show -topology
   ipmctl show -dimm
   // provision PMem in app direct mode
   ipmctl create -goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect
   // reboot system to make configuration take affect
   reboot
   // check capacity provisioned for app direct mode(AppDirectCapacity)
   ipmctl show -memoryresources
   // show the PMem region information
   ipmctl show -region
   // create namespace based on the region, multi namespaces can be created on a single region
   ndctl create-namespace -m fsdax -r region0
   ndctl create-namespace -m fsdax -r region1
   // show the created namespaces
   fdisk -l
   // create and mount file system
   sudo dmsetup create striped-pmem
   mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 -E stride=512 -F /dev/mapper/striped-pmem
   mkdir -p /mnt/pmem
   mount -o dax /dev/mapper/striped-pmem /mnt/pmem
```
   
   For more information you can refer to [Quick Start Guide: Provision IntelÂ® Optaneâ„¢ DC Persistent Memory](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/quick-start-guide-configure-intel-optane-dc-persistent-memory-on-linux.html)

- SQL Data Source Cache uses Plasma as a node-level external cache service, the benefit of using external cache is data could be shared across process boundaries.  [Plasma](http://arrow.apache.org/blog/2017/08/08/plasma-in-memory-object-store/) is a high-performance shared-memory object store and a component of [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow). We have modified Plasma to support PMem, and make it open source on [oap-project-Arrow](https://github.com/oap-project/arrow/tree/arrow-4.0.0-oap-1.1.1) repo. If you have finished [OAP Installation Guide](OAP-Installation-Guide.md), Plasma will be automatically installed and then you just need copy `arrow-plasma-4.0.0.jar` to `$SPARK_HOME/jars`. For manual building and installation steps you can refer to [Plasma installation](./Developer-Guide.md#Plasma-installation).


- Refer to configuration below to apply external cache strategy and start Plasma service on each node and start your workload.


#### Configuration for enabling PMem cache

Add the following configuration to `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf`.

```
# 2x number of your worker nodes
spark.executor.instances          6
# enable SQL Index and Data Source Cache extension in Spark
spark.sql.extensions              org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions

# absolute path of the jar on your working node, when in Yarn client mode
spark.files                       $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar,$HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
# relative path to spark.files, just specify jar name in current dir, when in Yarn client mode
spark.executor.extraClassPath     ./plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar:./pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar
# absolute path of the jar on your working node,when in Yarn client mode
spark.driver.extraClassPath       $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/plasma-sql-ds-cache-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar:$HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/pmem-common-<version>-with-spark-<version>.jar

# for parquet file format, enable binary cache
spark.sql.oap.parquet.binary.cache.enabled                   true
# for ORC file format, enable binary cache
spark.sql.oap.orc.binary.cache.enabled                       true
# enable external cache strategy 
spark.oap.cache.strategy                                     external 
spark.sql.oap.dcpmm.free.wait.threshold                      50000000000
# according to your executor core number
spark.executor.sql.oap.cache.external.client.pool.size       10
```
Start Plasma service manually

Plasma config parameters:  

```
 -m  how much Bytes share memory Plasma will use
 -s  Unix Domain sockcet path
 -d  PMem directory
```

Start Plasma service on each node with following command, then run your workload. If you install OAP by Conda, you can find `plasma-store-server` in the path **$HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/bin/**.

Change the permission of `/tmp/plasmaStore` to 777 if you are not `root` user to run following command.

```
./plasma-store-server -m 15000000000 -s /tmp/plasmaStore -d /mnt/pmem  
```

Remember to kill `plasma-store-server` process if you no longer need cache, and you should delete `/tmp/plasmaStore` which is a Unix domain socket.  
  
- Use Yarn to start Plasma service  
When using Yarn(Hadoop version >= 3.1) to start Plasma service, you should provide a json file as below.
```
{
  "name": "plasma-store-service",
  "version": 1,
  "components" :
  [
   {
     "name": "plasma-store-service",
     "number_of_containers": 3,
     "launch_command": "plasma-store-server -m 15000000000 -s /tmp/plasmaStore -d /mnt/pmem",
     "resource": {
       "cpus": 1,
       "memory": 512
     }
   }
  ]
}
```

Run command  ```yarn app -launch plasma-store-service /tmp/plasmaLaunch.json``` to start Plasma server.  
Run ```yarn app -stop plasma-store-service``` to stop it.  
Run ```yarn app -destroy plasma-store-service```to destroy it.


### Verify PMem cache functionality

- After finishing configuration, restart Spark Thrift Server for the configuration changes to take effect. Start at step 2 of the [Use DRAM Cache](#use-dram-cache) guide to verify that cache is working correctly.

- Check PMem cache size by checking disk space with `df -h`.


## Run TPC-DS Benchmark

This section provides instructions and tools for running TPC-DS queries to evaluate the cache performance of various configurations. The TPC-DS suite has many queries and we select 9 I/O intensive queries to simplify performance evaluation.

We created some tool scripts [oap-benchmark-tool.zip](https://github.com/oap-project/oap-tools/releases/download/v1.1.1-spark-3.1.1/oap-benchmark-tool.zip) to simplify running the workload. If you are already familiar with TPC-DS data generation and running a TPC-DS tool suite, skip our tool and use the TPC-DS tool suite directly.

### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7+ is required on the working node. 

### Prepare the Tool

1. Download [oap-benchmark-tool.zip](https://github.com/oap-project/oap-tools/releases/download/v1.1.1-spark-3.1.1/oap-benchmark-tool.zip) and unzip to a folder (for example, `oap-benchmark-tool` folder) on your working node. 
2. Copy `oap-benchmark-tool/tools/tpcds-kits` to ***ALL*** worker nodes under the same folder (for example, `/home/oap/tpcds-kits`).

### Generate TPC-DS Data

1. Update the values for the following variables in `oap-benchmark-tool/scripts/tool.conf` based on your environment and needs.

   - SPARK_HOME: Point to the Spark home directory of your Spark setup.
   - TPCDS_KITS_DIR: The tpcds-kits directory you coped to the worker nodes in the above prepare process. For example, /home/oap/tpcds-kits
   - NAMENODE_ADDRESS: Your HDFS Namenode address in the format of host:port.
   - THRIFT_SERVER_ADDRESS: Your working node address on which you will run Thrift Server.
   - DATA_SCALE: The data scale to be generated in GB
   - DATA_FORMAT: The data file format. You can specify parquet or orc

   For example:

```
export SPARK_HOME=/home/oap/spark-3.1.1
export TPCDS_KITS_DIR=/home/oap/tpcds-kits
export NAMENODE_ADDRESS=mynamenode:9000
export THRIFT_SERVER_ADDRESS=mythriftserver
export DATA_SCALE=1024
export DATA_FORMAT=parquet
```

2. Start data generation.

   In the root directory of this tool (`oap-benchmark-tool`), run `scripts/run_gen_data.sh` to start the data generation process. 

```
cd oap-benchmark-tool
sh ./scripts/run_gen_data.sh
```

   Once finished, the `$scale` data will be generated in the HDFS folder `genData$scale`. And a database called `tpcds_$format$scale` will contain the TPC-DS tables.

### Start Spark Thrift Server

Start the Thrift Server in the tool root folder, which is the same folder you run data generation scripts. Use either the PMem or DRAM script to start the Thrift Server.

#### Use PMem as Cache Media

Update the configuration values in `scripts/spark_thrift_server_yarn_with_PMem.sh` to reflect your environment. 
Normally, you need to update the following configuration values to cache to PMem.

- --num-executors
- --driver-memory
- --executor-memory
- --executor-cores
- --conf spark.oap.cache.strategy
- --conf spark.sql.oap.dcpmm.free.wait.threshold
- --conf spark.executor.sql.oap.cache.external.client.pool.size

These settings will override the values specified in Spark configuration file ( `spark-defaults.conf`). After the configuration is done, you can execute the following command to start Thrift Server.

```
cd oap-benchmark-tool
sh ./scripts/spark_thrift_server_yarn_with_PMem.sh start
```
In this script, we use `external` as cache strategy for Parquet Binary data cache. 

#### Use DRAM as Cache Media 

Update the configuration values in `scripts/spark_thrift_server_yarn_with_DRAM.sh` to reflect your environment. Normally, you need to update the following configuration values to cache to DRAM.

- --num-executors
- --driver-memory
- --executor-memory
- --executor-cores
- --conf spark.executor.sql.oap.cache.offheap.memory.size
- --conf spark.executor.memoryOverhead

These settings will override the values specified in Spark configuration file (`spark-defaults.conf`). After the configuration is done, you can execute the following command to start Thrift Server.

```
cd oap-benchmark-tool
sh ./scripts/spark_thrift_server_yarn_with_DRAM.sh  start
```

### Run Queries

Execute the following command to start to run queries. If you use `external` cache strategy, also need start plasma service manually as above.

```
cd oap-benchmark-tool
sh ./scripts/run_tpcds.sh
```

When all the queries are done, you will see the `result.json` file in the current directory. You will find in the 2nd and 3rd round, cache feature takes effect and query time becomes less.
And the Spark webUI OAP tab has more specific OAP cache metrics just as [section](#use-dram-cache) step 5.

## Advanced Configuration

- [Cache Hot Tables](./Advanced-Configuration.md#Cache-Hot-Tables) 

  Data Source Cache also supports caching specific tables according to actual situations, these tables are usually hot tables.

- [Column Vector Cache](./Advanced-Configuration.md#Column-Vector-Cache) 

  This document above uses **binary** cache as example for Parquet file format, if your cluster memory resources is abundant enough, you can choose ColumnVector data cache instead of binary cache for Parquet to spare computation time.

- [Large Scale and Heterogeneous Cluster Support](./Advanced-Configuration.md#Large-Scale-and-Heterogeneous-Cluster-Support) 
  
  Introduce an external database to store cache locality info to support large-scale and heterogeneous clusters.

For more information and configuration details, please refer to [Advanced Configuration](Advanced-Configuration.md).
