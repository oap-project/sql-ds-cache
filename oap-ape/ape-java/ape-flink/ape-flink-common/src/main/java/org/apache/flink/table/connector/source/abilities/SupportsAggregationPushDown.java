/**
 * For particular agg functions (eg. SUM, MAX, MIN, AVG, COUNT), the workload can be pushed down to
 * data source. Commonly, filters should be pushed down too so that the data source can get the
 * partial aggregation result.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example,
 *     select sum(d_date_sk) from date_dim where d_year = 2000;
 * The original plan of above sql in Flink may be:
 * == Optimized Logical Plan ==
 * HashAggregate(isMerge=[true], select=[Final_SUM(sum$0) AS EXPR$0])
 * +- Exchange(distribution=[single])
 *    +- LocalHashAggregate(select=[Partial_SUM(d_date_sk) AS sum$0])
 *       +- Calc(select=[d_date_sk], where=[=(d_year, 2000)])
 *          +- TableSourceScan(table=[[myhive, tpcds_1g_snappy, date_dim, filter=[],
 *              project=[d_date_sk, d_year]]], fields=[d_date_sk, d_year])
 *
 * The plan after filters are pushed down:
 *== Optimized Logical Plan ==
 * HashAggregate(isMerge=[true], select=[Final_SUM(sum$0) AS EXPR$0])
 * +- Exchange(distribution=[single])
 *    +- LocalHashAggregate(select=[Partial_SUM(d_date_sk) AS sum$0])
 *       +- TableSourceScan(table=[[myhive, tpcds_1g_snappy, date_dim,
 *          filter=[equals(d_year, 2000)], project=[d_date_sk]]], fields=[d_date_sk])
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Moreover, aggregations are pushed down, the optimized plan becomes:
 * == Optimized Logical Plan ==
 * HashAggregate(isMerge=[true], select=[Final_SUM(sum$0) AS EXPR$0])
 * +- Exchange(distribution=[single])
 *    +- TableSourceScan(table=[[myhive, tpcds_1g_snappy, date_dim,
 *          filter=[equals(d_year, 2000)], project=[d_date_sk], aggregation=[sum$0]]],
 *          fields=[sum$0])
 * </p>
